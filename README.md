Mini-Game created for the eXia's Game Jam 2017.

## Context

For the game jam of 2017 (a video game developement competition), the differents 3rd years of Cesi Exia had 
to build up a little video game.</br>
The most of us never designed a game, so we begin this competition without experience.

## The game

Our game story was inspired of a french resistant which made missions for the allies in french country.</br>

### Scenario

Our french resistant have to spy a german factory in France and finally destroy sensible weapons in it.

### Game design

#### view and moves

The design is in top view, the player control the hero moves. The camera is centred on the hero and follow him.

#### Shot

The player can shot in the same direction of his body.

## Unity

For this game, we used Unity. We had to up our skills on it first, this part took many times and so slow us on the realisatipn of the project.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our game is not finished caused by the learning of Unity application, the organisation to make this game and the short
competition time.</br>
